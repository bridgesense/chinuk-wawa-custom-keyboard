# Chinuk Wawa - XKB integration (Linux)

Chinuk Wawa is a trade language once in use by many of the Pacific Northwest Native American tribes. It is the official language of the [Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde](https://www.grandronde.org/services/education/shawash-ili%CA%94i-skul/) and taught in an immersive classroom setting.

This installs a Chinuk Wawa custom keyboard onto most Linux distributions without the need for installing any additional software and is compatible with the KDE windows manager.

## Installation

1. Open a terminal and run the following command. You will need the root password to install the file.
```
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgesense/chinuk-wawa-custom-keyboard/custom > /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/custom
```
2. Activate the layout on your desktop via the keyboard settings by selecting "A user-defined custom Layout". Here's an example for KDE Plasma.
